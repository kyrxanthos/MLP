# MLP - Machine Learning in Python

This repository includes the two assignments made for the University of Edinburgh's course [Machine Learning in Python](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/21-22/dpt/cxmath11205.htm) from the School of Mathematics.

Topics covered in the course include:

Topics may include:

- Introduction: supervised vs. unsupervised learning, regression vs. classification
- Linear regression: basis function expansion, overfitting
- Training, testing, generalisation, cross-validation, evaluating/comparing models
- Classification (logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision trees/random forests)
- Regularisation/sparse regression (ridge and lasso)
- Unsupervised clustering (k-means, hierarchal clustering)

## Coursework

### The Office

In this project I investigated the features which make an episode of ‘The Office’ successful. I used the `schrutepy` package for the investigations and created a Machine Learning model that predicts the features that make an episode of ‘The Office’ have a high IMDb rating. The goal was to give an insight into how these features can be used to create a successful reunion episode. 


The final jupyter notebook and report is `The_Office/The_Office_Reunion.ipynb`.

### Lisbon Hotels

In this project, I investigated why customers cancel their reservations and provide a model to predict cancellations. I used data collected by Antonio, Almedia and Nunes (2019) on hotel bookings.

The final jupyter notebook and report is `Lisbon_Hotels/MLP2_final.ipynb`.
